# Anomaly-Detection-in-Random-Number-Generation
This research proposes a device for generating and analyzing random single-digit numbers (0-9). It establishes statistical baselines and uses machine learning for real-time anomaly detection. The numbers are logged for audit trails, aiding in cryptography, data analysis, and simulations.
